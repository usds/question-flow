### Asking quality questions

Help us help you!

Spending time framing a question and adding support links or resources makes it
much easier for us to help.
Itâ€™s easy to fall into the trap of asking something too specific when youâ€™re
close to a problem.
Then, those trying to help you out have to spend a lot of time asking additional
questions to understand what you are hoping to achieve.

Spending the extra time up front can help save everyone time in the long run.

- Try to define what you need help with:
  - Is there something in particular you want to do?
  - What problem are you encountering and what steps have you taken to try
        and fix it?
  - Is there a concept youâ€™re not understanding?
- Learn about the [rubber duck debugging method][rubberduck]
- Avoid falling for the [XY problem][xy]
- Search on GitHub to see if a similar question has been asked
- If possible, provide sample code, a [CodeSandbox][], or a video
- The more time you put into asking your question, the better we can help you
