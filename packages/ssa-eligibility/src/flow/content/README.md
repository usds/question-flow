# Content

This folder contains all of the copy used within the application. Copy is content that is purely informational, explanatory or relevant to customers because it is displayed to customers somewhere in the application.

If the content you are looking for is _not_ copy, then look in [`/src/flow/logic`](../logic/README.md).
