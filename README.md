If you have questions, you have questionable content. Questionable is a USDS React component that transforms complex workflows into a simple, linear wizard.

![q](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73488661/122292423-fb993b00-cec3-11eb-91c6-ddb37a4ec7c7.gif)

## Install

Install this package with npm or yarn:

```sh
yarn add @usds.gov/questionable
```

or

```sh
npm i @usds.gov/questionable
```

## Usage 

It is strongly suggested applications use the same version of [USWDS](https://designsystem.digital.gov/) that is used by [@trussworks/react-uswds](https://github.com/trussworks/react-uswds). A version mismatch may result in unexpected markup & CSS combinations. This project will stay current with @trussworks/react-uswds, which is often behind the USWDS by a point release or two.

You can import Questionable components using ES6 syntax:

```ts
import { Questionable } from '@usds.gov/questionable';
```

## Organization

This project is comprised by four sub-projects (aka "packages", "workspaces"). The root of the project contains configuration and utilities for all sub-projects. Workspaces are located in `/packages`. Common functions such as `yarn build` and `yarn lint` can be run from the root of the project and will run on each sub-project in turn.

### The Component (Questionable)

This project represents the generic web component. This is the code behind the `@usds.gov@questionable` package published to NPM. This project provides a generic wizard suitable for testing eligibility workflows and perhaps other point of entry flows that rely on simple state machine mechanics and can be expressed as a set of linear steps with rules governing their sequence according to branching logic.

- `components`: UI components used for rendering each question in the survey
- `composable`: Stateful classes that organize the components into a unified app
- `lib`: Generic helper utilities
- `schema`: Auto-generated JSON schema representing the data model
- `state`: React reducer for the aggregation of survey data
- `survey`: Core interfaces and classes for the data structure of the question/anwer/results

### Storybook

This project demonstrates the Questionable component and its subcomponents in the Storybook portfolio with working examples of the use of the plugin.

### Tests

Still in-progress collection of unit tests to assert that each data point is evaluated and resolved thus validating an entire workflow is valid (or not).

### ssa-eligibility

An implementation of Questionable using live, production data.

## Background

The primary deliverable is a published npm package that can be included as a dependency in other projects that use USWDS with React. In order for these components to be useful, they should follow best practices for accessible, semantic, markup; be well-tested across browsers and devices; and allow for an appropriate level of customization. We adhere to a set of [development guidelines](./github/CONTRIBUTING.md) as much as possible and use automation to enforce tests, linting, and other standards.

### Non-Goals

This is not meant to be a one-size-fits-all front end solution, We are starting off with the opinionated decision to cater towards projects that use the U.S. Design System 2.0, and encapsulate these specific styles and markup in React components.

## Development

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the storybook for the components.\
Open [http://localhost:9009](http://localhost:9009) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `yarn deploy`

Builds and deploys the app to GitHub Pages.
